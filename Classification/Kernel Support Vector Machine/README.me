#Machine Learning, classification, Kernel Support Vector Machine
This program uses Kernal Support Vector Machine (SVM) to determine if someone is likely to buy a product or not.

Kernal support vector machine uses a kernal to add an aditional dimention to the data. A support vector plane is then able to cut the data shape. The intersection of the plane with the data is then projected back to the original dimentions. The resulting line is a kernal SVM regression line.
