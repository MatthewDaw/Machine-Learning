#Machine Learning, classification, K Nearnest Neighbors
This program uses K means clustering to determine if someone is likely to buy a product or not.

K nearest neighbor takes a training set of points and stores them in a matrix. If someone requests a classification for a new point the algorithm will determine within a certain radius the points are like around it and classify the new point accordingly.
