#Machine Learning, reinforcement learning, Thompson sampling
This program uses Thompson sampling to determine in real-time which of nine advertisements is most effective at generating sales.

Thompson sampling begins by assuming each advertisement has a very wide distribution of possibilities. As samples are pulled, the bounds begin to narrow and the algorithm favors testing the advertisement with the best upper bound. As time goes on, the algorithm beings exploiting the best advertisement more and more until it effectively stops trying out the other possibilities.
