Apriori algorithm used to determine what items customers will likely buy with other items.

This algorithm takes for input reciept information of what customers buy at a grocery store. It then determins if a customer buys an item what additional item they are likely to buy with it. This causal direction does not go necessarily go two ways. For exmaple, if we know that a customer buys light cream then we can infer that they will likely also buy chicken to go with it. However, if a customer buys light creame then the algorithm does not indicate that they will buy chicken. 

This algorithm can help them make decisions decisions such as how to display merchandise or how to offer discount deals. The algorithm can also be easily adapted to make a type of movie recommender system.
