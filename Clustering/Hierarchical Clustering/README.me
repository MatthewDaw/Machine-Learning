#Machine Learning, clustering, Hierarchical Clustering
This program uses  Hierarchical Clustering to find possible clusters that different types of buyers can be categorized into.

Hierarchical clustering begins by classifying each point as a “cluster”. It then recursively combines the closest clusters until there is only one cluster left. While doing this, the algorithm keeps track of the euclidian distance between each cluster as it was formed. The algorithm then determines the largest continuous gap of the distance across all cluster combinations. It counds the number of clusters that are formed under this threshold and uses to produce the desired amount of the output of clusters (see the graph and it’ll make more sense.)
