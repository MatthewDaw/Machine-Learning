#Machine Learning, clustering, K Means Clustering
This program uses K means clustering to find possible clusters that buyers can be categorized into.

K means clustering randomly assigns a certain number of cluster centroids on a set of data. The clusters are then adjusted to fit squarely into what is the best possible local cluster. A variance is calculated by how close the points in a cluster are to the cluster. Theoretically, if someone assigns as many clusters as there are points then the variance would be zero. As such, users have to balance lower variance scores with the generality of their clusters.
