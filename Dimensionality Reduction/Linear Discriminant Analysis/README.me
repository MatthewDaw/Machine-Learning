#Machine learning, dimensionality reduction, Linear discriminant analysis
This program uses linear discriminant analysis to determine which of three categories a wine fits into given a fairly large list of the different variables describing the wine.

Linear discriminant analysis uses Bayesian statistics to draw boundaries in a dataset. The boundaries, in turn, decide which of three categories each entry fits into.
