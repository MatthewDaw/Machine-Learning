#Machine learning, dimensionality reduction, Principle Component Analysis
This program uses principle component analysis to determine from a realtively large set of dimensions which of three general categories a wine is best fits under.

Principle component analysis is able to reduce the dimensionality of a multi-dimensional table into just two simple dimensions. Once the points are plotted with the reduced dimensions, the variance of each point relative to the others becomes very clear by how close the points are to each other.
