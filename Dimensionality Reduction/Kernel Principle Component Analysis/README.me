#Machine learning, dimensionality reduction, Kernal Principle component analysis 
This program uses kernel principal component analysis to determine if a user is likely to respond to an advertisement based on their demographics. 

For this problem, the data is non-linear so there is no clear linear boundary that can separate the buyers from the non-buyers. As such, we use Kernel Principal Component Analysis which uses a kernel to add another dimension into the data based off the variance of the data around it. With the kernel, normal principal component analysis is able to determine a more clear boundary in the data and separate it accordingly.
