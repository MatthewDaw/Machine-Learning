This program uses decision tree regression to estimate employeesâ€™ salaries based off their position in the company. 

Decision tree regression determines pivotal points where the data changes enough to justify a change in output. These pivot points are given a hierarchy which turns into a binary tree. The leaves of the binary tree are the final output and the branches are the conditions to get to the different leaves.
