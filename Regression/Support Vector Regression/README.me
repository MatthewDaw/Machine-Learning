#Machine Learning, regression, Support Vector Regression
This algorithm uses support vector regression to determine the salary of an employee based on his position in a company.

Support vector regression creates a kernel in the data by giving it an extra dimension. A plane then bisects the new object using a form of the simple linear regression formula. The intersection of the plane with the surface is projected onto the x y plane. The resulting line is the regression curve.
